<p><strong>Basic Data Structures in JavaScript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I explored fundamental data structures in JavaScript, focusing on arrays and objects. I learned to differentiate between these structures, understand their use cases, and apply various JavaScript methods to manage and manipulate data effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Programming language for implementing data structures and methods.</li>
  <li><strong>Array Methods:</strong> Built-in functions for managing arrays.</li>
  <li><strong>Object Methods:</strong> Built-in functions for managing objects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding Arrays and Objects:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Explored the key differences between arrays and objects, including their use cases, and how each data structure can be leveraged based on the specific needs of a project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Array Manipulation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized array methods such as <code>splice()</code> to add, remove, or replace elements within an array, enhancing data management and manipulation capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Object Manipulation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Employed <code>Object.keys()</code> to retrieve an array of a given object's property names, facilitating access and iteration over object properties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Access and Transformation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented techniques for accessing and transforming data within arrays and objects, applying methods and operations to achieve desired results.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Cases and Best Practices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzed various scenarios to determine when to use arrays versus objects, and applied best practices for efficient data handling and manipulation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
